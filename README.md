# dum

A referenDUM tool.


### TODO

1. Replace the Django secret before launching into production.
2. Use settlements.txt, perhaps set up a database?
4. Make sure any checker exceptions are handled on the UI.
5. Set `settings.DEBUG` to `False`.
6. That's a far stretch, but the EGN has a municipality encoded,
   perhaps use it to match the address?
